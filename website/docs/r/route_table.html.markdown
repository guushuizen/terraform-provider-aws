# Resource: aws_route_table

Provides a resource to create a VPC routing table.

~> **NOTE on Route Tables and Routes:** Terraform currently
provides both a standalone [Route resource](route.html) and a Route Table resource with routes
defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line routes
in conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will cause
a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.

~> **NOTE on `gateway_id` and `nat_gateway_id`:** The AWS API is very forgiving with these two
attributes and the `aws_route_table` resource can be created with a NAT ID specified as a Gateway ID attribute.
This _will_ lead to a permanent diff between your configuration and statefile, as the API returns the correct
parameters in the returned route table. If you're experiencing constant diffs in your `aws_route_table` resources,
the first thing to check is whether or not you're specifying a NAT ID instead of a Gateway ID, or vice-versa.

~> **NOTE on `propagating_vgws` and the `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation` resource:**
If the `propagating_vgws` argument is present, it's not supported to _also_
define route propagations using `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation`, since
this resource will delete any propagating gateways not explicitly listed in
`propagating_vgws`. Omit this argument when defining route propagation using
the separate resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_route_table" "example" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.example.id

  route {
    cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.example.id
  }

  route {
    ipv6_cidr_block        = "::/0"
    egress_only_gateway_id = aws_egress_only_internet_gateway.example.id
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "example"
  }
}
```

To subsequently remove all managed routes:

```terraform
resource "aws_route_table" "example" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.example.id

  route = []

  tags = {
    Name = "example"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

* `vpc_id` - (Required) The VPC ID.
* `route` - (Optional) A list of route objects. Their keys are documented below. This argument is processed in [attribute-as-blocks mode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/attr-as-blocks.html).
This means that omitting this argument is interpreted as ignoring any existing routes. To remove all managed routes an empty list should be specified. See the example above.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `propagating_vgws` - (Optional) A list of virtual gateways for propagation.

### route Argument Reference

This argument is processed in [attribute-as-blocks mode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/attr-as-blocks.html).

One of the following destination arguments must be supplied:

* `cidr_block` - (Required) The CIDR block of the route.
* `ipv6_cidr_block` - (Optional) The Ipv6 CIDR block of the route.
* `destination_prefix_list_id` - (Optional) The ID of a [managed prefix list](ec2_managed_prefix_list.html) destination of the route.

One of the following target arguments must be supplied:

* `carrier_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a carrier gateway. This attribute can only be used when the VPC contains a subnet which is associated with a Wavelength Zone.
* `core_network_arn` - (Optional) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a core network.
* `egress_only_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a VPC Egress Only Internet Gateway.
* `gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a VPC internet gateway or a virtual private gateway.
* `local_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a Outpost local gateway.
* `nat_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a VPC NAT gateway.
* `network_interface_id` - (Optional) Identifier of an EC2 network interface.
* `transit_gateway_id` - (Optional) Identifier of an EC2 Transit Gateway.
* `vpc_endpoint_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a VPC Endpoint.
* `vpc_peering_connection_id` - (Optional) Identifier of a VPC peering connection.

Note that the default route, mapping the VPC's CIDR block to "local", is created implicitly and cannot be specified.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

~> **NOTE:** Only the target that is entered is exported as a readable
attribute once the route resource is created.

* `id` - The ID of the routing table.
* `arn` - The ARN of the route table.
* `owner_id` - The ID of the AWS account that owns the route table.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

- `create` - (Default `5m`)
- `update` - (Default `2m`)
- `delete` - (Default `5m`)

## Import

Import Route Tables using the route table `id`. For example:

```
$ terraform import aws_route_table.public_rt rtb-4e616f6d69
